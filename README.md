# Cool Project Station

For the third module in this bootcamp we had to finish the functions of a website and improve its appearance using mainly React.

## Functionality

Actually the website includes the possibility of the creation of a virtual card through a formulary, with information about projects introduced by the user such as the repository, the web or the languages used.
